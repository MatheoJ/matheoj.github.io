    "Presentation1":"Passionate about robotics since middle school, I was introduced to computer science around the middle of high school thanks to the engineering science option and the computer specialty. The first two generalist years at INSA Lyon only confirmed this interest with introductory subjects in algorithms and computer science, and the projects that we were able to carry out there. So I naturally chose the IT department for my third year.",
    "Presentation2":"During this year I had the chance, thanks to the Tech4Good association, to discover the world of industry by carrying out a sentiment detection project in comments for the company Open Source Politics.",
    "Presentation3":"To end this year, I did a software development internship in the Liris laboratory. In an Algorithmic research team, I was able to develop an application to find strategies for the game family \"k in a row\".",
    "Presentation4":"Very interested in software development, I am currently looking for an internship in this specialtie for May 2023.",

    "Internship_Text":"Between June and September 2022 I did software development internship within an algorithmic research team in the Liris laboratory. I was in charge of realizing an application which compute the optimal strategies allowing to never lose in 'k in a row' (a kind of tic tac toe where the players must align k symbols on an infinite grid). This internship was a real challenge both on the algorithmic side, and on the optimization of calculations from a temporal point of view and memory management.",
    "OSP":"Sentiment analysis API in comments, for the Open Source Politics company.",
    "OSP_Text":"I had the chance during the year 2022 to be able to carry out a sentiment analysis project in comments with the company Open Source Politics. This project allowed me to discover several very important facets such as the training of a machine learning model, the GIT management of a larger project, the dockerization of my code, or even the production.",
    "AirWatcher": "Application to control and process data from air purity sensors.",
    "AirWatcher_Text":"This project was done as part of a software engineering course. As a group we had to carry out a functional analysis of the need in order to provide documents concerning the specifications and the design of the application, before moving on to the realization. The application itself performs calculations on data, in order to display relevant information. Using the Catch2 testing framework. Project completed in 2022",
    "Analog": "Application for analysis of HTTP log produced by Apache.",
    "Analog_Text": "Application processing .log files, which allows you to obtain all sorts of statistics concerning HTTP request logs. Unit tests have been implemented for all program features. Project completed in 2022",
    "Reactif": "FrontEnd of a concierge web application.",
    "Reactif_Text": "As part of a course on applications for information systems, in groups of 2, we received a back end and an interface model made by other students, we then had to make the front end of this application which allows customers and employees to consult their current interventions and view other relevant statistics. This project was carried out using an MVC architecture. Made in 2022",
    "Predictif":"BackEnd of an application for making appointments with mediums.",
    "Predictif_Text":"As part of a course on applications for information systems, in groups of 2, we received a brief concerning an application to be created. After a study of the need, we coded the back end of this application following a layered architecture. After writing the specifications document and a model of our graphical interface, our project was transferred to another group of students for its web integration. Made in 2022",
    "Pandemic":"Local multiplayer game inspired by the board game Pandemic.",
    "Pandemic_Text":"This game was made as part of the introductory course in Algorithms and programming. It uses the rules of the pandemic board game in which 2 to 4 players must cooperate to eradicate a disease that is spreading on the map. On each turn, players can perform different types of actions such as exchanging cards, treating disease, founding a research center, finding a vaccine etc... Project carried out in 2021",
    "Tracker":"Reverse engineering and optimization of the algorithm of a solar tracker.",
    "Tracker_Text":"To complete the engineering science baccalaureate option, we studied a solar tracker. After understanding how it works, we were able to model it entirely on matlab, in order to carry out tests for its optimization. Our solution has increased electricity production by 15%. This project earned us a mark of 20/20 in the baccalaureate. Made in 2019",
    "Minautorus":"Browser-based local multiplayer game inspired by the board game Minautorus.",
    "Minautorus_Text":"As part of the final project of the Computer Baccalaureate specialty, we made this browser game inspired by the minautorus board game. In a labyrinth, 4 players compete to be the first to place their 3 pawns in the middle, they also have the option of moving the minautore placed in the center to eat their opponents or moving the walls of the labyrinth. This project earned us a mark of 20/20 in the baccalaureate. Made in 2019",
    "Pipetor":"Creation of a DNA sampler robot for the Hospices Civiles de Lyon laboratory.",
    "Pipetor_Text":"As part of the end of second year project at INSA, we, in a group of 5, designed, 3d printed, assembled and programmed a robot to collect a liquid at a precise and extremely low flow rate in order not to break the DNA strands that are there. This robot was made to meet a need of the laboratories of the civil hospices of Lyon. This project earned us the prize for the best end-of-year project. Made in 2021",
    "Labelisor": "Comment labeling application.",
    "Labelisor_Text": "As part of my project with the company Open source politics, I had to label hundreds of comments by hand. Many labeling tools exist but in my specific case I had to label a comment according to the text that is commented. I did not find a satisfactory tool so I made this utility. Made in 2022",
    "TagDetector":"Tag detection on a flat surface, with image cropping.",
    "TagDetector_Text":"As part of the participation in the French robotics cup of ClubElek (INSA association), I was able to carry out this computer vision application aimed at obtaining the coordinates on the board, of tokens identified by ARUCO tags. In order to obtain precise coordinates, a homography is carried out to \"straighten\" the image, and thus counter the fact that the camera is not located exactly above the stage. Made in 2021",
